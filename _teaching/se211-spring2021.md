**Description**

This course introduces advanced programming skills and focuses on the core concepts of object-oriented programming and design using a high-level language, either Python or Java. Object-oriented programming represents the integration of software components into a large-scale software architecture. Software development in this way represents the next logical step after learning coding fundamentals, allowing for the creation of sprawling programs. The course focuses on the understanding and practical mastery of object oriented concepts such as classes, objects, data abstraction, methods, method overloading, inheritance and polymorphism. It allows code organization in general and concept in particular. Students are intended to break down problems from structured & semi-structured requirements such as a class-diagram or scenario (not a user-story).

**Course Objectives**
* To explain the principles of object-oriented programming in a higher-level programming language
* To analyze a problem statement to develop a mental model of objects necessary to create a software architecture
* To utilize object-oriented programming to frame software architectures, with care towards separation of concerns
and abstraction
* To demonstrate the skills in solution designing, and programming software for reuse of code.

**Course Learning Outcomes (CLO)**
* CLO1: Develop understanding of writing object-oriented programs that combine functions and data
* CLO2: Analyze a problem statement to develop a mental model of objects necessary to create a software architecture
* CLO3: Apply the object-oriented programming language to develop software, including programs utilizing multiple
Classes
* CLO4: Translate abstract concepts into Classes in software
* CL05: Present and defend technical aspects of object oriented software development
